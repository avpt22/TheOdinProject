Arrays 
    Variables that holds more values


Converting arrays to strings
toString() 
    Converts an array to a string of comma seperated array values. 
        ex. 
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    (document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = )fruits.toString(); #getElementById returns an element object from HTML that matches an id with a specific string. 
        result:
    Banana,Orange,Apple,Mango

join()
    Also joins all array elements into a string. It behaves like toString(), but you can also specify the seperator. 
        ex.
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    fruits.join(" * ")
        result:
    Banana * Orange * Apple * Mango


Popping and pushing
    Working with arrays it's easy to remove elements and add new elements.
    popping: 
        out of an array
    pushing:
        into an array
pop()
    removes the last element from an array
        ex.
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    fruits.pop();
        result:
    Banana,Orange,Apple

    Can also return the value that was popped out:
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    let fruit = fruits.pop();
        Mango
